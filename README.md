##
Every day you get a new drink with instructions on how to make it, including the ingredients, the glass it should be served in, and a picture of what it should look like. Think of it as "The Drink of the Day!"

## Info

* Completely configurable. The .css file included helps you modify size of image, text, color, any way you like it.
* For best results in left or right regions constrain the size using maxWidth and the .css examples provided.
* For best results in top_bar/bottom_bar/thirds increase maxWidth to stretch across your mirror and modify css.
* Need a color chart? No problem. http://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/
* No API key is necessary at the moment.

## Installation

* `git clone https://github.com/mykle1/MMM-Cocktails.git` into the `~/MagicMirror/modules` directory.
